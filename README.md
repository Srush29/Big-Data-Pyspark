##Used Car Listings Price Prediction

Overview of the project

We know that the prices of brand-new cars are increasing day by day. This has led to an increase in the number of customers who prefer buying used cars. We aim to examine the used car pricing data, gain insights, and predict the prices of the used cars. Using these insights, people who need to sell their car can decide an estimated price. Similarly, anyone who would be interested in purchasing the car will be able to determine the appropriate price beforehand.
